- Fixes improper display of install/transfer warning on the server console page.
- Fixes permission matching for the server settings page to correctly allow access when a user has _any_ of the needed permissions.

### Changed

- Moves the server data blocks to the right-hand side of the console, rather than the left.
- Rather than defaulting graph values at `0` when resetting or refreshing the page, their values are now hidden entirely.
- **[security]** Hides IP addresses from all activity log entries that are not directly associated with the currently signed in user.

### Added

- Adds the current resource limits for a server next to each data block on the console screen.

## v1.9.0

### Added

- Added support for using Tailwind classes inside components using `className={}` rather than having to use `twin.macro` with the `css={}` prop.
- Added HeadlessUI and Heroicons packages.
- Added new `Tooltip.tsx` component to support displaying tooltips within the Panel.
- Adds a new activity log view for both user accounts and individual servers. This builds upon data collected in previous releases.
- Added a new column `api_key_id` to the `activity_logs` table to indicate if the user performed the action while using an API key.
- Adds initial support for language translations on the front-end. The underlying implementation details are working, however work has not yet begun on actually translating all of the strings yet. Expect this to continue in future releases.
- Improved accessibility for navigation icons by adding a tooltip on hover to indicate what each one does.
- Adds logging for API keys that are blocked from performing an API action due to IP address limiting.
- Adds support for `?filter[description]=foo` when querying servers on both the client and application API.

### Changed

- Updated how release assets are generated to perform more logical bundle splitting. This should help reduce the amount of data users have to download at once in order to render the UI.
- Upgraded From TailwindCSS 2 to 3 — for most people this should have minimal if any impact.
- Chart.js updated from v2 to v3.
- Reduced the number of custom colors in use — by default we now use Tailwind's default color pallet, with the exception of a custom gray scheme.
- **[deprecated]** The use of `neutral` and `primary` have been deprecated in class names, prefer `gray` and `blue` respectively.
- Begins the process of dropping the use of Gravatars for user avatars and replaces them with dynamically generated SVG images.
- Improved front-end route definitions to make it easier for external modifications to inject their routes and components into the codebase without having to modify as many core files.
- Redesigned the server console screen to better display data users might be looking for, and increase the height of the console itself.
- Merged the two network data graphs into a single dual-line graph to better display incoming and outgoing data volumes.
- Updated all byte formatting logic to use `1000` as the divisor rather than `1024` to be more consistent with what users most likely expect.
- Changed the underlying `eslint` rules applied to the front-end codebase to simplify them dramatically. We now utilize `prettier` in combination with some basic default rulesets to make it easier to understand the expected formatting.

### Fixed

- Fixes a bug causing a 404 error when attempting to delete a database from a server in the admin control panel.
- Fixes console input auto-capitalizing and auto-correcting when entering text on some mobile devices.

- Fixes mobile keyboards automatically attempting to capitalize and spellcheck typing on the server console.
- Fixes improper support for IP address CIDR ranges when creating API keys for the client area.
- Fixes a bug preventing additional included details from being returned from the application API when utilizing a client API key as an administrator.

## v1.8.1

### Fixed

- Fixes a bug causing mounts to return a 404 error when adding them to a server.
- Fixes a bug causing the Egg Image dropdown to not display properly when creating a new server.
- Fixes a bug causing an error when attemping to create a new server via the API.

## v1.8.0

**Important:** this version updates the `version` field on generated Eggs to be `PTDL_v2` due to formatting changes. This
should be completely seamless for most installations as the Panel is able to convert between the two. Custom solutions
using these eggs should be updated to account for the new format.

This release also changes API key behavior — "client" keys belonging to admin users can now be used to access
the `/api/application` endpoints in their entirety. Existing "application" keys generated in the admin area should
be considered deprecated, but will continue to work. Application keys _will not_ work with the client API.

### Fixed

- Schedules are no longer run when a server is suspended or marked as installing.
- The remote field when creating a database is no longer limited to an IP address and `%` wildcard — all expected MySQL remote host values are allowed.
- Allocations cannot be deleted from a server by a user if the server is configured with an `allocation_limit` set to `0`.
- The Java Version modal no longer shows a dropdown and update option to users that do not have permission to make those changes.
- The Java Version modal now correctly returns only the images available to the server's selected Egg.
- Fixes leading and trailing spaces being removed from variable values on file manager endpoints, causing errors when trying to perform actions against certain files and folders.

### Changed

- Forces HTTPS on URLs when the `APP_URL` value is set and includes `https://` within the URL. This addresses proxy misconfiguration issues that would cause URLs to be generated incorrectly.
- Lowers the default timeout values for requests to Wings instances from 10 seconds to 5 seconds.
- Additional permissions (`CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES`, `CREATE VIEW`, `SHOW VIEW`, `EVENT`, and `TRIGGER`) are granted to users when creating new databases for servers.
- development: removed Laravel Debugbar in favor of Clockwork for debugging.
- The 2FA input field when logging in is now correctly identified as `one-time-password` to help browser autofill capabilities.
- Changed API authentication mechanisms to make use of Laravel Sanctum to significantly clean up our internal handling of sessions.
- API keys generated by the system now set a prefix to identify them as Pterodactyl API keys, and if they are client or application keys. This prefix looks like `ptlc_` for client keys, and `ptla_` for application keys. Existing API keys are unaffected by this change.

### Added

- Added support for PHP 8.1 in addition to PHP 8.0 and 7.4.
- Adds more support for catching potential PID exhaustion errors in different games.
- It is now possible to create a new node on the Panel using an artisan command.
- A new cron cheatsheet has been added which appears when creating a schedule.
- Adds support for filtering the `/api/application/nodes/:id/allocations` endpoint using `?filter[server_id]=0` to only return allocations that are not currently assigned to a server on that node.
- Adds support for naming docker image values in an Egg to improve front-end display capabilities.
- Adds command to return the configuration for a specific node in both YAML and JSON format (`php artisan p:node:configuration`).
- Adds command to return a list of all nodes available on the Panel in both table and JSON format (`php artisan p:node:list`).
- Adds server network (inbound/outbound) usage graphs to the console screen.
- Adds support for configuring CORS on the API by setting the `APP_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=example.com,dashboard.example.com` environment variable. By default all instances are configured with this set to `*` which allows any origin.
- Adds proper activity logging for the following areas of the Panel: authentication, user account modifications, server modification. This is an initial test implementation before further roll-out in the software. Events are logged into the database but are not currently exposed in the UI — they will be displayed in a future update.

### Removed

- Removes Google Analytics from the front end code.
- Removes multiple middleware that were previously used for configuring API access and controlling model fetching. This has all been replaced with Laravel Sanctum and standard Laravel API tooling. This should make codebase discovery significantly more simple.
- **DEPRECATED**: The use of `Pterodactyl\Models\AuditLog` is deprecated and all references to this model have been removed from the codebase. In the next major release this model and table will be fully dropped.

## v1.7.0

### Fixed

- Fixes typo in message shown to user when deleting a database.
- Fixes formatting of IPv6 addresses when displaying allocations to users.

- Adds support for Pug and Jade in the file editor.
- Adds an entry to the `robots.txt` file to correctly disallow all bot indexing.

## v1.6.6

### Fixed

- **[security]** Fixes a CSRF vulnerability for both the administrative test email endpoint and node auto-deployment token generation endpoint. [GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/security/advisories/GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6)

### Added

- Adds foreign key relationship on the `mount_node`, `mount_server` and `egg_mount` tables.
- Adds environment variable `PER_SCHEDULE_TASK_LIMIT` to allow manual overrides for the number of tasks that can exist on a single schedule. This is currently defaulted to `10`.
- OOM killer can now be configured at the time of server creation.

### Changed

- Server updates are not dependent on a successful call to Wings occurring — if the API call fails internally the error will be logged but the server update will still be persisted.

### Removed

- Removed `WingsServerRepository::update()` function — if you were previously using this to modify server elements on Wings please replace calls to it with `::sync()` after updating Wings.

### Added

- Adds support for automatically copying SFTP connection details when clicking into the text field.
- Messaging about a node not having any allocations available for deployment has been adjusted to be more understandable by users.
- Adds automated self-upgrade process for Pterodactyl Panel once this version is installed on servers. This allows users to update by using a single command.
- Adds support for specifying a month when creating or modifying a server schedule.
- Adds support for restoring backups (including those in S3 buckets) to a server and optionally deleting all existing files when doing so.
- Adds underlying support for audit logging on servers. Currently this is only used by some internal functionality but will be slowly expanded as time permits to allow more robust logging.
- Adds logic to automatically reset failed server states when Wings is rebooted. This will kick servers out of "installing" and "restoring from backup" states automatically.

### Changed

- Updated to `Laravel 8` and bumped minimum PHP version from `7.3` to `7.4` with PHP `8.0` being the recommended.
- Server state is now stored in a single `status` column within the database rather than multiple different `tinyint` columns.

## v1.0.0

Pterodactyl 1.0 represents the culmination of over two years of work, almost 2,000 commits, endless bug and feature requests, and a dream that
has been in the making since 2013. 🎉

Due to the sheer size and timeline of this release I've massively truncated the listing below. There are numerous smaller
bug fixes and changes that would simply be too difficult to keep track of here. Please feel free to browse through the releases
tab for this repository to see more specific changes that have been made.

### Added

- Adds a new client-facing API allowing a user to control all aspects of their individual servers, or servers
  which they have been granted access to as a subuser.
- Adds the ability for backups to be created for a server both manually and via a scheduled task.
- Adds the ability for users to modify their server allocations on the fly and include notes for each allocation.
- Adds the ability for users to generate recovery tokens for 2FA protected logins which can be used in place of
  a code should their device be inaccessible.
- Adds support for transfering servers between Nodes via the Panel.
- Adds the ability to assign specific CPU cores to a server (CPU Pinning) process.
- Server owners can now reinstall their assigned server egg automatically with a button on the frontend.

### Changed

- The entire user frontend has been replaced with a responsive, React backed design implemented using Tailwind CSS.
- Replaces a large amount of complex daemon authentication logic by funneling most API calls through the Panel, and using
  JSON Web Tokens where necessary to handle one-time direct authentication with Wings.
- Frontend server listing now includes a toggle to show or hide servers which an administrator has access to, rather
  than always showing all servers on the system when logged into an admin account.
- We've replaced Ace Editor on the frontend with a better solution to allow lighter builds and more end-user functionality.
- Server permissions have been overhauled to be both easier to understand in the codebase, and allows plugins to better
  hook into the permission system.

### Removed

- Removes large swaths of code complexity and confusing interface designs that caused a lot of pain to new developers
  trying to jump into the codebase. We've simplified this to stick to more established Laravel design standards to make
  it easy to parse through the project and make contributions.

### Changed

- `allocation_limit` for servers now defaults to a null value, and is not required in PATCH/POST requests when adding
  a server through the API.
- The `PATCH` endpoint for `/api/applications/servers/{server}/build` now accepts an array called `limits` to match

### Removed

- Removed all old theme JS and CSS folders to cleanup and avoid confusion in the future.
- Old API calls to `Server::create` will fail due to changed data structure.
- Many old routes were modified to reflect new standards in panel, and many of the controller functions being called were also modified. This shouldn't really impact anyone unless you have been digging into the code and modifying things.
- `Server::getUserDaemonSecret(Server $server)` was removed and replaced with `User::daemonSecret(Server $server)` in order to clean up models.
