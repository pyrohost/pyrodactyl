### Responsible Disclosure

This is a fairly in-depth project and makes use of a lot of parts. We strive to keep everything as secure as possible
and welcome you to take a look at the code provided in this project yourself. We do ask that you be considerate of
others who are using the software and not publicly disclose security issues without contacting us first by email.

We'll make a deal with you: if you contact us by email, and we fail to respond to you within a week you are welcome to
publicly disclose whatever issue you have found. We understand how frustrating it is when you find something big and
no one will respond to you. This holds us to a standard of providing prompt attention to any issues that arise and
keeping this community safe.

If you've found what you believe is a security issue please email `naterfute@pyro.host`. Please check
[SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) for additional details.
