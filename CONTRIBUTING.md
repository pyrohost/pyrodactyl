# Contributing

pyro.host does not accept Pull Requests (PRs) _for new functionality_ from users that are not currently employed
or affiliated by Pyro. It has become overwhelming to try and give the proper time and attention that such
complicated PRs tend to require â€” and deserve. As a result, it is in the project's best interest to limit the scope
of work on new functionality to work done within the Pyro team.

PRs that address existing _bugs_ with a corresponding issue opened in our issue tracker will continue to be accepted
and reviewed. Their scope is often significantly more targeted, and simply improving upon existing and well defined
logic.

### Responsible Disclosure

This is a fairly in-depth project and makes use of a lot of parts. We strive to keep everything as secure as possible
and welcome you to take a look at the code provided in this project yourself. We do ask that you be considerate of
others who are using the software and not publicly disclose security issues without contacting us first by email.

We'll make a deal with you: if you contact us by email, and we fail to respond to you within a week you are welcome to
publicly disclose whatever issue you have found. We understand how frustrating it is when you find something big and
no one will respond to you. This holds us to a standard of providing prompt attention to any issues that arise and
keeping this community safe.

If you've found what you believe is a security issue please email `team@pyro.host`. Please check
[SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) for additional details.
