# Pterodactyl Panel - Docker Image

This is a ready to use docker image for the panel.

## Requirements

This docker image requires some additional software to function. The software can either be provided in other containers (see the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/develop/docker-compose.example.yml) as an example) or as existing instances.

A mysql database is required. We recommend the stock [MariaDB Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) image if you prefer to run it in a docker container. As a non-containerized option we recommend mariadb.

A caching software is required as well. We recommend the stock [Redis Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) image. You can choose any of the [supported options](#cache-drivers).

You can provide additional settings using a custom `.env` file or by setting the appropriate environment variables in the docker-compose file.

## Setup

Start the docker container and the required dependencies (either provide existing ones or start containers as well, see the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/blob/develop/docker-compose.example.yml) file as an example.

After the startup is complete you'll need to create a user.
If you are running the docker container without docker-compose, use:

```
docker exec -it <container id> php artisan p:user:make
```

If you are using docker compose use

```
docker-compose exec panel php artisan p:user:make
```

## Environment Variables

There are multiple environment variables to configure the panel when not providing your own `.env` file, see the following table for details on each available option.

Note: If your `APP_URL` starts with `https://` you need to provide an `LE_EMAIL` as well so Certificates can be generated.

### Cache drivers

You can choose between different cache drivers depending on what you prefer.
We recommend redis when using docker as it can be started in a container easily.

| Driver | Description                 | Required variables |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| redis  | host where redis is running | `REDIS_HOST`       |
| redis  | port redis is running on    | `REDIS_PORT`       |
| redis  | redis database password     | `REDIS_PASSWORD`   |

### Mail drivers

You can choose between different mail drivers according to your needs.
Every driver requires `MAIL_FROM` to be set.

| Driver   | Description                          | Required variables                                         |
